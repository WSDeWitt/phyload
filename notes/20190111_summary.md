# New year, skew year

## Goal

Today, the three of us met and we recapped what we did back before the holidays, thought about some new test statistics, and made tentative plans to meet in the next two-ish weeks.

The big topics we covered were

1. Why are the alignments with epistatic sites more invariant than we thought? Is this a scaling problem?   
2. We have been using the goldman multinomial in our first pass simulations but we want to move to some more epistasis related statistics. What could these be?  

## Do we need an adult?

As always, the question of whether or not we should talk to someone else about this project came up.
Specifically, we were wondering if we should talk to someone about surprising invariance of the epistatic alignments.
In the end, as always, we decided no!
We had two (good) reasons  
1. We have an idea of how to address the problem of scaling. We should try this first.
2. It might be a good idea to bring the analysis forward a little bit more and build out the pipeline even if the alignments are less than ideal.

## Are we scaling everything correctly?

We all wrote out the same justification for the scaling using different notation (in models.pdf).
So, we feel pretty good about how we are scaling things.

We spent some time looking at the plot Andy made with the number of invariant sites for alignments with are iid, 50% epistatic with the old scaling and epistatic with the new scaling.
The new scaling has an "intermediate phenotype", which means it helped a little but not as much as we would have thought.

Another concern was that the the branch lengths are not exactly the same as mutations in our model, or generally, in non Jukes-Cantor models.
So while GTR models will have this problem, the model we are using has some extra intricacies which may exacerbate the model.

Andy is going to look at this by trying to "Jukes-Cantor-ify" our model and see if the differences goes away.
That is, make the rates and nucleotide frequencies equal.

## What are specific-epistasis-specific test statistics?

Thus far, our analysis has been using the multinomial test statistic.
While the preliminary results seem to indicate that we can tell the iid alignments from the epistatic alignments using this test statistic, we would like something that is picking up on the epistasis signal specifically, not some general misspecification.

We sketched out a new test statistic based on pairwise site-covariation.
We expect the alignments with epistasis to skew the distribution of pairwise site covariation.
Will is going to work on formalizing this test statistic.

Sarah is going to look through the papers for Gabe's rotation project and try to find some other statistics.
