# Flu HA data

## [`flu_HA.fasta`](flu_HA.fasta)
This codon alignment has 49 human seasonal H1N1 sequences from 1918 to 2008.
There is at most 1 sequence per year and each sequence has 1,692 nucleotides.

## [`flu_HA.nexus`](flu_HA.nexus)
This is the tree inferred under GTR+CAT using `RAxML`.
I don't have the fit parameters anymore so it probably makes the most sense to re-infer the tree from the alignment.

## [`flu_HA.nexus.png`](flu_HA.nexus.png)]
Here is the tree above:

Here is a fun flu fact (FFF).
If you look at the tips they march through time (pretty well) except there is a gap in the years from the 50s to the 70s.
This is because human seasonal H1N1 had gone extinct in the 50s but was re-introduced into the population in the 70s.
So 20 years had passed but because the virus had been frozen 0 _evolutionary_ years had passed.
